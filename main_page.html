				<p>Finally made normal money camming today($150). I also got some help setting this up on the internet with github. The guy who helped me was one of my clients and turns out he is a programmer and a really nice guy. I can't wait to progress this site. :D so happy with how things are going as of right now. Also been rollerblading again. I'm now at 4miles. with a small break. I traveled to the downtown library and back. </p></div>

				<p>Still camming for work. Averaging about $65/day. Income has declined by about 35% from last month. I declined the job at The United States Postal Services because of the lifting requirement being so frequent for mail handlers. I assumed I was going to be a clerk or clerks assistant or something behind a desk. I was wrong. I started making this site a few days ago and its coming along nicely. I have to work on the layout but so far so good I'd say. Simple but still works. And kind of getting pretty. I made a lot of changes since beginning this project. I removed the page that had pictures of "me" aka cats and have changed a lot of the css choices I've made so far to be more "professional?" </p>

				<p>Found a way to get the frosted look but it doesn't blur it only frosts. I also decided to go with a color instead of an image as the background. This will also keep the files limited so my folder for this project doesn't have a million things inside. I think this is really what I want to do for a living. It is frustrating (like mega frustrating at times) but really fun still, and I always want to improve my work.
