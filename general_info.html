				<p>I am the first child in my family. I have one brother who is 16. I have lived in Las Vegas, NV; South Jordan, UT; Sandy, UT; Hurricane, UT; and Salt Lake City; UT. I grew up both Catholic and another deviation of Christian though I thought of myself as Catholic most of my life. Once in college I decided I was Atheist. In school I got mostly A's and B's and I was the cute, innocent (how ironic considering my work history now), and shy girl. My high school sweat heart and I were together from 10th grade- half of my first year of college. Where I met a few guys but only one really stuck around for more than two weeks. I met my current fiance from a friend. He went to the same school as I did, but he was in the animation program. I went over to his place to watch a movie and then he walked me home. I offered for him to stay the night and it's been one big sleep over ever since. We moved in together right away and shared bank accounts too. I realized recently though that somewhere along the way I lost myself and what I stood for. That is what I'm doing now trying to get back on track. I found that I really like web development by accident working on my "bio" on my cam girl website. And I picked my favorite subject math back up.</p><br>
				<p>I always found technology interesting; I was the kid messing with all the settings on anything "new" I got. Weather that was a laptop 10 years outdated or a new but second hand ipod touch. I wanted to know how it worked what all the settings did. I wanted to know everything about it. But I was too afraid to mess with code or anything like that. When I was about 14 I found out how to do all sorts of things; torrent movies, download mods for a game (Pets5 from UBI Soft what a dork I was), download music using youtube converters, and a little html from school (the very very basics). Most of it I learned on my own but some of the concepts came to me in school. In middle school I had taken a class called multi-media where we made little websites, made powerpoint cartoons, learned to use MS Office, and lots of other things. I took that class for two years it was my favorite.
